This is a story about a man named ANONYMIZED_NAME and it begins at the end
Some of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something. They're trying to find someone who's going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give, and not a place that you go to take.

So today was my birthday which was very cool although being ANONYMIZED_NUMBER makes me feel ridiculous... like I can't believe that its been almost ten years since I graduated from college. Yowza. Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday today. One of the axioms I live by is that the only things that change you are the books you read and the people you know. I 'm better for the people I know.

Today I would like to send a special thank you to all the military families who support their troops through all the heart ache, pain and loneliness that comes with field exercises, schools, and deployments. We love and appreciate all you do for us!

What would shaving 2$ of your wage entail?Life changing events?catastrophic proportions?Merely cutting back indulgences and luxuries? A few inconveniences that fade in time?Unfortunately it would and it can't be done. Not because the worker can't do it, but won't.The basis that the saved money would just be to make profit and not to better the existing work force. FOR PROFIT comes from the top and goes to the bottom.
the merry go round video made my day!
