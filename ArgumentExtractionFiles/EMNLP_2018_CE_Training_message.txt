So that was fun.....
It is for the best consideration of that child. If the couple were seperated, then he/she would be saddened that the father/mother might not be around as much as they are needed. This is bad for the child. Most of the times when miscarriages are reported, the couples are not married. Again this isn't bad, but God has a purpose for you in life, and that could be His way of telling you to reconsider your choices.
haha, im so sure this is gunna be a great year! gunna have FUNN!!!!

We begin from the recognition that all beings cherish happiness and do not want suffering. It then becomes both morally wrong and pragmatically unwise to pursue only one's own happiness oblivious to the feelings and aspirations of all others who surround us as members of the same human family. The wiser course is to think of others when pursuing our own happiness.

I have really found it difficult sometimes to be the person that GOD wants me to become. Its a shame that the people who should be supportive are the ones who try their best to tear you down. I changed me to make other people feel better when it was never about them. Always remember that when dealing with GOD, OBEDIENCE IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE!!!""

Please put this in your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity. People need to understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously. You could be sitting next to a sufferer right now. There is still no known cure for stupidity, and sympathy does not help. But we can raise awareness. ...93% won't do this because they don't know how to copy and paste

Search deep into your mind,\nAnd answers you will find,\nUntil you meet that special someone,\nThen your soul becomes undone,\nIn the bliss it was so pure,\nYou could Have dreamed of nothing more,\nBut then we trek until the end,\nTo find that on only ourselves can we depend.\n\nHow do you like my original poem :P Seriously.........................

Putting one foot in front of the other...more like dragging one foot in front of the other.
When you become detached mentally from yourself and concentrate on helping other people with their difficulties, you will be able to cope with your own more effectively. Somehow, the act of self-giving is a personal power-releasing factor. (the pisces man )
1 year older and got thrown into the pool...haha...THX 4 the birthday wishes and THANKZ so much 4 the surprise i had on my birthday!!! I enjoyed it a lot ^_^
If you and I woke up in jail together...using only FOUR words...what would you say to me? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny (and interesting) things your friends say. (And if you make a comment, you gotta put this in your status. Fair is fair)

Put\n this on your status if you know someone who suffers from being a \nTottenham fan. Being a Tottenham Fan is a real disorder and should be \ntaken seriously.

Join us,to keep \ntottenham fans away from our lives......for ever .. :D

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness, so there is no cure & it's not contagious. They only want what we all want, to be accepted. 95% of you probably won't copy and paste this. Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour? It's Special Education Week, and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding
We can live without religion and meditation, but we cannot survive without human affection.

Be very careful if you make a woman cry, because God counts her tears. The woman came out of a man's rib, not from his feet to be walked on, not from his head to be superior, but from his side to be equal! Under the arm to be protected, & next to the heart to be loved. Copy and paste if you agree!
Thanks for all the birthday messages!

those who have resources within themselves, who can dare to live alone, want friends the least, but, at the same time, best know how to prize them the most. But no company is far preferable to bad, because we are more apt to catch the vices of others than their virtues, as disease is far more contagious than health.

Hi Lord, its me. Things are getting bad here, gas prices are too high, no jobs, food and heating cost too high. I know some have taken you out of our schools, government & even Christmas.

Well after roughly 5 and 1/2 hours at the E.R., ANONYMIZED_NAME has the flu and not pneumonia thankfully. But after the fit I threw in the E.R. I don't think ANONYMIZED_NAME Hospital will welcome me back with open arms. But ya know it's amazing that when you starting yelling how fast they manage to get you back to see a Dr. I mean come on, 3 hours in the waiting room is ridiculous!!
WHY? Why the hell do people do that? Don't pretend your friends with someone if you don't like them, for the love of God! You have absolutely no guts if you can't even admit that you said something about them. No, you have no guts if you can't even tell them to their face!

the BYU game was a win-win situation. If BYU won, BYU won obviously which is good. But BYU lost, so that finally shuts up the stupid BSU fans that think they will make it to the BCS because they beat Hawaii, Bowling Green, UC Davis and the only real game of the entire year, Oregon. omg such tough teams!
Off to Boston, WOOOT!!

Facebook won't let me have an island:( Maybe they are down for maintenance or something. Also I am feeling much better from my stay in the hospital, they gave me good drugs:0) The hard thing is I can't eat stuff with little seeds in it anymore, like strawberries or corn, that's gonna be tough.
Okay, I was online with some weird people the other day, and I was alerted to this video: ANONYMIZED_URL It is disturbing as hell and no I'm not sick for looking and watching it.

But in the spirit of commemoration - whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday - I thought we could mark this ANONYMIZED_DATE ANONYMIZED_DATE ANONYMIZED_DATE, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.

Please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who has been eaten by a dragon. My wish for 2010 is that people will understand, that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of. Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying. 93% won't copy and paste this... They have been eaten by dragons...

Ok, random question ok? No hidden meaning or whatsoever to it. Here goes, what do you call the emotion that you feel, when you feel like you wanna be with this person every day. You dun really care what you are doing or if it's something that you dun really like. You just want to be as close to the person as possible, no matter what! Don't say google it! I just did, and it gave me a load of crap Zzzzz =.=
The Game, That Is All.

A TRUE FRIEND doesn't care if your house is untidy, your car makes funny noises,if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week, or that your family isn't perfect....they love you as you are!!!

My wife came home today. They couldn't find a definite cause for what happened, but they are saying it was a possible TIA which is a decrease in blood to an area of the brain rather than a total blockage like in a stroke. She is still showing symptoms, but that seems to be getting better. Sometime I wonder why they don't try to find out why it's happinig rather than treating symptoms.

They say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking & \nnever question their friendship. These types of friends pick up like \nthey just spoke yesterday, regardless of how long it has been or how \nfaraway they live, and don't hold grudges. They understand that lifeis \nbusy, but that you will always love them. Re-post if you a.........re blessed to have at least one of these friends
thanks everyone for their birthday wishes!

I learn that people come to your life for a season, it up to you to learn the reason why they here!
There comes a time in life when you have to let go of all the pointless drama and the people who create it, and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus solely on the good. After all life is too short to be anything but happy. Its easy to blame others for things you do takes the pressure of yah self.
Why do things never work out?!
Will today be over already!!!!
oh the games people try to play thinking they can win against an asshole like me....hahahaha fucking whores
Atleast its Friday, Im ready for the week to be over and ready to start my new area next week.
Chillin in the Barracks

I love how when I lay down at night with my daughter to put her to bed, she leans over and kisses me on the cheek after she thinks I'm asleep.
All human actions have one or more of these seven causes: chance, nature, compulsions, habit, reason, passion, desire.
Just chilaxin at home thinking about what to do tomorrow....
ANONYMIZED_NAME ANONYMIZED_NAME ANONYMIZED_NAME, born ANONYMIZED_NUMBER ANONYMIZED_DATE ANONYMIZED_DATE ANONYMIZED_DATE, ANONYMIZED_NUMBERlbs ANONYMIZED_NUMBERoz. Mum and ANONYMIZED_NAME are both fine.
the only way this day could be worse would be if i got hit by a bus, oh wait i almostdid.
Tried to sleep in today, no work , no school . But of course once I wake up I cannot go back to sleep . I just wish the Sandman would throw a bag of sand in my eyes at point blank range, it might hurt but at least ill be asleep .
s alarm did not go off this morning. It's a sign that school needs to be done for the year.
Though I may be walking in the wilderness, it's like a walk in the park because I know that God got my back! It's already done!

ANONYMIZED_NAME: Don't you hate that?\nANONYMIZED_NAME: What?\nANONYMIZED_NAME: Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?\nANONYMIZED_NAME: I don't know. That's a good question.\nANONYMIZED_NAME: That's when you know you've found somebody special. When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.
Before today I made it 364 days without getting a tattoo. Guess I better go stay with ANONYMIZED_NAME ANONYMIZED_NAME in rehab and start the count over!

God wants me to know.......that I will feel better if I notice the sweetness of life. Notice the smiles of children, the songs of the birds, the caress of the sun's warmth. This sweetness is for me. Allow it to soothe my soul and bring a smile to my face.
The size of your success is measured by the strength of your desire; the size of your dream; and how you handle disappointment along the way............
