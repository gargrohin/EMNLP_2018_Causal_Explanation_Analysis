The way the movie order goes is: Watch a movie, then the next movie you watch has an actor or actress that was in the previous movie. The next movie does the same but you can't repeat that same actor or actress again. Basically, don't use the same actor 3 times in a row. You can use them later in the list just not 3 times consecutively. We watch a movie every night or other night. We are up to Dec. so far!

People think it's an obsession. A compulsion. As if there were an irresistible impulse to act. It's never been like that. I chose this life. I know what I'm doing. And on any given day

I am finally out of school and have my MBA!!!!! - It's been a long 2 years and so much has changed in my life. I can't believe it's finally over.
I am switching from regular cigarette and rollies to the electronic-cigarette, cutting out 100's of deadly toxins, tar, and second-hand smoke. One small step for man, one giant step for Turtle-Kind.
ANONYMIZED_NAME found her house key!!! Yay!! Good job kid!
What is the damn deal now? I mean everyone wants to kick us even when we are down. Is it because we are MICHIGAN?? I am all in for RICH ROD but every school does this and i can name names at Clemson, USF and at Florida. So, kids who wanna workout and watch film are going to pay the price. It is because we are MICHIGAN AND MICHIGAN and we will have a NO FLY ZONE!! GO BLUE AND SCREW THE DETROIT FREEP!

Sometimes i really have to wonder at peoples common sense, like they just float through life believing everything they are told and when confronted with truth fall apart or deny it.
